# Simple Calculator in Java (Swing-based)

## Description
This is a simple calculator application built using Java Swing. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project demonstrates the use of Java Swing components like `JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JLabel`, `JButton`, and `JTextField` to create an interactive and user-friendly application.

## Features
### User-friendly Interface
- Intuitive layout for ease of use.
- Clearly labeled input fields and buttons.

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition**: Adds two numbers and displays the result.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (handles exceptions for invalid input).

### Error Handling
- Displays error messages for invalid inputs or operations like division by zero.

### Reset Functionality
- Clears all input fields and the result field for fresh calculations.

### Responsive Design
- Adjusts components to fit the frame.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Java Swing for GUI

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ## How to Run

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. Compile and run the `Demo.java` file.
3. The application window will open, allowing you to perform arithmetic operations.

## Usage

1. Enter two numbers in the input fields labeled `Num 1` and `Num 2`.
2. Click on one of the operation buttons (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`) to perform the corresponding operation.
3. The result will be displayed in the `Result` field.
4. Use the `RESET` button to clear all fields and start a new calculation.
## Error Handling

- Displays a pop-up message if invalid input (non-numeric values) is entered in the input fields.
- Handles division by zero gracefully by showing an error message.
